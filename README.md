# SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data for the eight cities

This repository contains fasta and metadata files for sequences obtained from samples from PCR+ patients. 
Samples were collected between March 2020 and December 2022 in the eight Brazilian capitals participating of the COVID-IgG project (Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Fortaleza, Manaus, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, São Paulo).
